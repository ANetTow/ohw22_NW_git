# Git exercise for OHW22 NW satetllite

We'll use this repository as the sand box for practicing using Git and GitHub.

- Make sure everyone's comfortable with the basics:
  - create a repository on GitHub
  - git clone
  - git add
  - git commit
  - git push
- We'll then try out the fork-branch-pull request workflow:
  - fork (on GitHub)
  - clone (to your own machine)
  - set remote (on your own machine)
  - branch (on your own machine)
  - make changes add/commit/push (to your own fork)
  - create a pull request, or "PR" (on GitHub)
